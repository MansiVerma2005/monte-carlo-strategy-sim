This project simulates stock price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and evaluates 4 trading strategies:

- Buy & Hold
- Trailing Stop Loss
- Moving Average Crossover
- Bollinger Band Mean Reversion

We analyze profit distribution and risk under varying volatilities using Monte Carlo simulation.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Time series simulation
- Strategy backtesting
- Risk-return visualization
- Sharpe Ratio analysis

## Output
Notebook: `monte_carlo_strategies.ipynb`
